## Rock Paper Scissors (Console Game)

This project is a console-based Rock Paper Scissors game built as part of The Odin Project JavaScript Foundations curriculum.

The game is played entirely in the browser console and focuses on core JavaScript concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and scope.

## 📖 Description

The goal of this project was to implement the logic for a classic Rock Paper Scissors game where a human player competes against the computer over five rounds.

The player provides input via a prompt, the computer generates a random choice, and the game keeps track of scores before declaring a final winner.

## 🎮 How the Game Works

    1.	The player is prompted to enter rock, paper, or scissors
    2.	The computer randomly selects one of the three options
    3.	Each round determines a winner based on standard rules
    4.	Scores are updated after each round
    5.	After 5 rounds, the final winner is announced in the console

## 🛠️ Built With

    •	JavaScript (ES6)
    •	HTML5 (minimal setup)
    •	Browser Console

## 🎯 What I Practiced

    •	Writing reusable functions
    •	Using Math.random() for randomized behavior
    •	Handling user input with prompt()
    •	Applying conditional logic to determine outcomes
    •	Tracking state with variables and function scope
    •	Looping through multiple game rounds
    •	Logging meaningful output to the console

## ▶️ How to Run

    1.	Clone the repository
    2.	Open index.html in a browser
    3.	Open the browser developer console
    4.	Follow the prompts to play the game

## 📌 Notes

    •	This version of the game does not include a graphical interface
    •	Input validation is minimal, as per curriculum requirements
    •	The game logic is intentionally kept simple and readable
